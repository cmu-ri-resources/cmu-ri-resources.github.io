Are you thinking about attending grad school in computer science or robotics? Ever wondered what makes a strong application?

We are excited to announce three information sessions where we’ll talk about the Why, What and How of grad school. During three sessions we will go over the several aspects of applying to grad school: 

* Why should you apply for grad school? 
* How do you apply to grad school?
* What makes a strong graduate school application?
* What is life like as a grad student (at CMU)? 
* Q&A with the attendees.

Each session will facilitated by both professors and graduate students from the CMU Robotics Institute. 

## Who is this for?
We expect these sessions to benefit anyone from anywhere in the world who is interested in graduate school in robotics or a related area, especially those thinking about graduate school in the US. 

## When will the sessions be held and how can I watch?

The sessions will all be held on Zoom webinars and will be hosted at the following times:
